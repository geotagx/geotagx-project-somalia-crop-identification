This project experiments with identifying information on the effects of drought on crops.

We want to answer questions like:

1. What crops are growing where?
2. What is the scale of the agriculture?
3. Have the crops been affected by drought?

### How does it work?
You will be presented with a photo taken during a drought and asked a series of questions about what you can see in the photo.

Answer the questions as best you can. We highly recommend taking the tutorial before starting so you know what to look for.

**If you need some pointers, check out the help provided for the question.**

**Don't worry if you are not sure about your answer**, each photo is presented to at least 30 people and the final answers are taken from the majority response. So there is no problem if you get a couple wrong.

**Sometimes it will be difficult to see what is in the photo** - if you are not sure, don't be afraid to select "I DON'T KNOW", this is also a helpful answer!

Don't worry if you find lots of photos that are not relevant, or seem to have no useful data in them, often **no data is useful information for the project**, knowing where there is no drought is often as interesting as knowing where this is.

If you want more information on what sort of data is collected before, during, and after a disaster, have a look at the [Field Operations Guide for Disaster Assessment and Response](https://scms.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1866/fog_v4.pdf) produced by [USAID](http://www.usaid.gov/).

### What are we doing with the results?
**This is a demo application** to show how we could extract from photos information on the effects of drought on crops.

Results generated by your contributions will help us improve this application and others like it so that they could be deployed during a real drought or other disaster situations.

More generally we will also use these results to determine how these types of applications could be best used in a disaster situation.

Application co-developed with Lauren Young (Arcadia Center for Sustainable Food and Agriculture), [Ilya Fischhoff](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=2034311), Sarah Green (Michigan Tech), and Tom Sappington (USDA-ARS).
