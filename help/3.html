<p>What crops are being grown where is useful baseline information. Together with the method of cultivation this information could help us answer questions needed in the response effort such as: What crops are being grown? Are the cash or subsistence crops? Which crops are prefered by the local population? Are local farmers adapting to the weather conditions and planting more drought tolerant crops during dry years?</p>
<h3>How can I identify a crop species?</h3>
<p>
	Identifying the species of crop you are looking at from just a photo can be very difficult. Here are a few tips to help your search:
	<ul>
		<li>Look at the photo context, often the crop is written in the caption or other associated text.</li>
		<li>Compare the photos of the examples provided with the photo you are looking at</li>
		<li>Use the resources available on the internet to help you.</li>
		<li>Use Google! Follow the link under the thumbnail to begin searching</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p><strong>None of the suggestions match?</strong> Try looking for lists of agricultural products for the region or country you are working on. Under the "Other" box there should be a link to a document on the relevant agricultural sector, you can start your search from here.</p>
<p><strong>What to search for?</strong><ul><li>Keywords: "agriculture", "crops", the name of the country in which you are working</li><li>"What do they grow in XX country?"</li><li>Agricultural department (or similar), NGO's, or organisations like the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). These organisations often have inventories or reports on the agricultural activities within a particular country.</li></ul></p>
<p>Identifying a plant can often take some time, so don't get discouraged if you feel it is taking too long! And if you are stuck you can always click the "I don't know" button and move onto the next question.</p>
